                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p> <b>October 1931-27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the
                        president of India from 2002 to 2007.</b>

                    Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic
                    missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                    political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in
                    1974.

                    Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                    Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the
                    "People's President". He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He
                    was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
